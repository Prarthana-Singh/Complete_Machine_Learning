## 🌱 **1. What is Gradient Boosting?**

**Answer:**
Gradient Boosting is an **ensemble technique** that builds a **strong learner** by combining multiple **weak learners (usually decision trees)** sequentially. Each new model tries to correct the errors made by the previous ones by minimizing a **loss function** using **gradient descent**.

---

## ⚙️ **2. How does Gradient Boosting work?**

**Answer:**
It works in **three main steps**:

1. **Fit** an initial model (usually predicting the mean).
2. **Compute residuals (errors)** between actual and predicted values.
3. **Train a new model** to predict these residuals and **add it to the ensemble** with a weight (learning rate).
   This process repeats iteratively until the loss function converges or a max number of iterations is reached.

---

## 🔢 **3. What is the “Gradient” in Gradient Boosting?**

**Answer:**
The “gradient” represents the **direction of steepest descent** of the **loss function**.
Each tree is trained to **predict the negative gradient** (the error direction) of the loss function with respect to predictions, helping the model minimize the loss effectively.

---

## 🧮 **4. What loss functions can Gradient Boosting use?**

**Answer:**
Common loss functions include:

* **Regression:** Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Huber Loss
* **Classification:** Log Loss (binary/multiclass)
* **Ranking:** Pairwise or listwise loss (e.g., LambdaRank)

---

## ⚡ **5. What is the role of the learning rate?**

**Answer:**
The **learning rate (shrinkage)** controls how much each new tree contributes to the overall prediction.

* Small learning rate → better generalization but needs more trees.
* Large learning rate → faster training but higher risk of overfitting.

---

## 🌳 **6. What are weak learners in Gradient Boosting?**

**Answer:**
Typically **shallow decision trees (depth=3–5)**. They capture simple patterns and when combined iteratively, they form a powerful predictive model.

## 🧩 **7. What’s the difference between Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost?**

| Aspect        | Gradient Boosting                 | AdaBoost                          |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Error Type    | Fits to **residuals (gradients)** | Fits to **misclassified samples** |
| Loss Function | Customizable                      | Exponential loss only             |
| Optimization  | Gradient descent                  | Weighted sample reweighting       |

---

## 🧠 **8. How does Gradient Boosting prevent overfitting?**

**Answer:**
By using:

* **Learning rate** (small values like 0.01–0.1)
* **Tree regularization** (depth, min_samples_split, etc.)
* **Subsampling** (stochastic GB)
* **Early stopping**

---

## 💡 **9. What is Stochastic Gradient Boosting?**

**Answer:**
It’s a variant where **each tree is trained on a random subsample** of the data (rows or features).
This introduces randomness and reduces overfitting (used in XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.).

---

## 🧱 **10. What are the main hyperparameters in Gradient Boosting?**

* **n_estimators** → number of trees
* **learning_rate** → contribution of each tree
* **max_depth / max_leaf_nodes** → tree complexity
* **subsample / colsample_bytree** → stochastic boosting
* **min_samples_split / min_samples_leaf** → regularization

| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |

## 🧮 **12. How is Gradient Boosting trained?**

**Answer:**
Each iteration:

1. Compute gradient of loss wrt prediction.
2. Fit a tree to predict the negative gradient.
3. Update model:
   ( F_{m}(x) = F_{m-1}(x) + \eta \cdot h_m(x) )

## 📊 **17. How does feature importance work in Gradient Boosting?**

**Answer:**
It’s calculated by measuring how much each feature **reduces the loss function** when it’s used in a split, averaged across all trees.

## ⚔️ **18. What are the drawbacks of Gradient Boosting?**

**Answer:**

* Slower to train (sequential)

## 💬 **19. How can you interpret a Gradient Boosting model?**

**Answer:**
Use:

* **Feature importance plots**
* **Partial dependence plots (PDP)**
* **SHAP values** (most common today for explainability)

---

## 🧭 **20. Can Gradient Boosting handle missing values?**

**Answer:**
Some implementations (like XGBoost and LightGBM) handle missing values **internally** by learning the best default split direction for missing data.
