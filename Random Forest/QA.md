## 🌱 **1. What is a Random Forest?**

**Answer:**
Random Forest is an **ensemble learning algorithm** that builds **multiple Decision Trees** and combines their predictions through **voting (for classification)** or **averaging (for regression)**.
It reduces **overfitting** and improves **accuracy and stability** compared to a single tree.

---

## ⚙️ **2. How does Random Forest work?**

**Answer:**

1. **Bootstrap Sampling:** Randomly select subsets of data (with replacement).
2. **Tree Construction:** Build a Decision Tree for each subset.
3. **Feature Randomness:** Each split considers a **random subset of features**.
4. **Aggregation:** Predictions from all trees are combined by **majority vote (classification)** or **mean (regression)**.

This randomness ensures diversity among trees → **lower variance and better generalization.**

---

## 🧮 **3. Why is it called “Random” Forest?**

**Answer:**
Because both **data samples** (bootstrapping) and **features** (feature bagging) are chosen **randomly** for each tree — making each tree slightly different and independent.

---

## 🧠 **4. What is Bagging in Random Forest?**

**Answer:**
**Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)** is a technique where multiple models are trained on **random subsets of the data** (with replacement).
Their predictions are then **aggregated** to produce a final result.
This helps **reduce variance** and prevent overfitting.

## 🔢 **5. What is the main difference between Bagging and Boosting?**

| Aspect           | Bagging (RF)    | Boosting (XGBoost, AdaBoost) |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Model Building   | Parallel        | Sequential                   |
| Goal             | Reduce variance | Reduce bias                  |
| Weight Update    | Equal for all   | Adjusted per error           |
| Overfitting Risk | Lower           | Higher (if not regularized)  |
| Example          | Random Forest   | XGBoost, AdaBoost            |

## 🌳 **6. What are the hyperparameters of a Random Forest?**

| Parameter           | Description                                         |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `n_estimators`      | Number of trees                                     |
| `max_depth`         | Maximum depth of trees                              |
| `min_samples_split` | Minimum samples to split a node                     |
| `min_samples_leaf`  | Minimum samples in leaf node                        |
| `max_features`      | Number of features considered for split             |
| `bootstrap`         | Whether sampling is with replacement                |
| `criterion`         | Gini or Entropy (classification) / MSE (regression) |

## 🧩 **7. How does Random Forest reduce overfitting?**

**Answer:**
By combining **many uncorrelated Decision Trees**, Random Forest reduces variance through **averaging**.
Even if individual trees overfit, their combined output smooths out the noise, improving **generalization**.

---

## 💡 **8. What are the advantages of Random Forest?**

✅ Handles both classification and regression
✅ Reduces overfitting compared to a single tree
✅ Works well with missing values and categorical data
✅ Provides feature importance
✅ Handles high-dimensional data efficiently
✅ Robust to noise and outliers

---

## ⚠️ **9. What are the disadvantages of Random Forest?**

❌ Slower training and prediction (many trees)
❌ Less interpretable than single trees
❌ Can overfit with too many trees or deep trees
❌ Memory-intensive for large datasets

---

## 🧮 **10. How is the final prediction made in Random Forest?**

* **For classification:** By **majority voting** among all trees.
  [
  \hat{y} = mode(y_1, y_2, ..., y_n)
  ]
* **For regression:** By **averaging predictions** from all trees.
  [
  \hat{y} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i
  ]

---

## ⚡ **11. What is Out-of-Bag (OOB) Error in Random Forest?**

**Answer:**
Since each tree is trained on a **bootstrap sample**, about **1/3rd of the data** is left out.
This unseen data (OOB samples) is used to **validate the model performance** without separate test data.
OOB error gives an **unbiased estimate** of model accuracy.

---

## 🧠 **12. How does Random Forest handle missing values?**

**Answer:**

* It can use **proximity measures** to fill missing values.
* Or simply **ignore missing values** during split calculations.
  In sklearn, you generally handle missing values before training, but some implementations handle them internally.

---

## 📊 **13. How is feature importance calculated in Random Forest?**

**Answer:**
Feature importance is measured as the **average reduction in impurity** (Gini or Entropy) brought by a feature across all trees.
In sklearn:

```python
model.feature_importances_
```

Features with higher importance values are more predictive.

## 🔍 **14. What is the difference between Random Forest and Decision Tree?**

| Feature          | Decision Tree | Random Forest     |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| Model Type       | Single model  | Ensemble of trees |
| Overfitting      | High          | Low               |
| Variance         | High          | Reduced           |
| Bias             | Low           | Slightly higher   |
| Accuracy         | Moderate      | High              |
| Interpretability | Easy          | Complex           |

## 🧮 **15. How does Random Forest handle categorical features?**

**Answer:**
Categorical features are **encoded** into numerical values (e.g., label encoding, one-hot encoding).
Then, splits are made based on these encoded values.
Some advanced versions (like CatBoost) handle them natively.

---

## ⚔️ **16. What happens if we increase the number of trees (`n_estimators`)?**

**Answer:**
Initially, accuracy improves as variance reduces.
After a certain point, performance **plateaus** — adding more trees only **increases computation time** but doesn’t improve accuracy significantly.
Random Forest rarely overfits just by increasing trees.

---

## 🧭 **17. How does Random Forest perform feature selection?**

**Answer:**
Features that contribute most to reducing impurity are ranked higher in **feature importance**.
Less important features can be **dropped** without much performance loss.
This makes Random Forest a powerful **feature selection tool**.

---

## 🧮 **18. How can we evaluate a Random Forest model?**

**Answer:**

* **Classification:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
* **Regression:** RMSE, MAE, R²
* **Built-in:** OOB score (`oob_score=True` in sklearn)

---

## 🧩 **19. How does Random Forest handle unbalanced datasets?**

**Answer:**

* Use `class_weight='balanced'`
* Use **stratified sampling**
* Adjust **sample weights** or use **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
  This ensures minority classes get proper representation.
